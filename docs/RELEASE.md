# Release generation

Rustmix Wave has three release helpers:

```text
scripts/build-release-firmware.sh  Build an ELF-only firmware release bundle
scripts/flash-release.sh           Flash an existing release ELF safely
scripts/package-release.sh         Package the cleaned GitHub-ready source tree
```

## Supported release artifact

The supported firmware artifact is the ESP-IDF release ELF:

```text
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>.elf
```

Flash it with the ELF-aware `espflash flash` command:

```bash
./scripts/flash-release.sh \
  dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>.elf
```

Equivalent direct command:

```bash
espflash flash --chip esp32s3 --monitor \
  dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>.elf
```

Ordinary development flashing remains unchanged:

```bash
./scripts/flash.sh monitor
```

## Safety warning: do not use raw-address flashing

Do **not** use `espflash write-bin` for the release ELF or for any artifact from
this repository. `write-bin` is a raw-address operation. A raw write requires an
explicitly validated flash layout and correct bootloader, partition-table, and
application offsets.

The earlier unverified `*-flash.bin` artifact and the `write-bin ... 0x0`
workflow have been removed.

## Future merged factory image

A merged factory-image workflow remains deferred. It may be added only after all
of the following have been validated on physical hardware:

- Bootloader offset and image
- Partition-table offset and image
- Factory application partition offset
- Flash mode, frequency, and size
- Recovery procedure from ROM download mode

Until then, the ELF-aware `espflash flash` path is the only supported release
installation method.

## Build a firmware release

```bash
./scripts/build-release-firmware.sh
```

The script:

1. Runs `./scripts/validate.sh` unless `--skip-validate` is provided.
2. Builds the embedded release ELF with `cargo +esp build --release --target xtensa-esp32s3-espidf`.
3. Copies the ELF into `dist/`.
4. Copies the safe `flash-release.sh` helper into `dist/`.
5. Writes SHA-256 checksums.
6. Generates a release ZIP containing the ELF, flashing helper, checksum
   manifest, and flashing instructions.

Output naming:

```text
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>.elf
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>-flash-release.sh
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>-firmware-release.sha256
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>-FLASHING.txt
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>-firmware-release.zip
```

No `*-flash.bin` artifact is generated.

## Atlas Lite OTA contract

The M8 partition table reserves two 6 MiB application slots plus `otadata` on
the 16 MiB target. Rollback is enabled. An update is accepted only when all of
these checks pass:

- manifest fetched from the compile-time `ATLAS_LITE_OTA_ORIGIN` over HTTPS;
- Ed25519 signature verifies with `ATLAS_LITE_OTA_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX`;
- artifact URL remains below the fixed origin and `/atlas-lite/` prefix;
- semantic version is newer, size is non-zero and at most 6 MiB;
- streamed application image length and SHA-256 match the signed manifest.

The canonical signed payload is `atlas-lite-ota-v1`, followed by version,
build, artifact URL, size, and lowercase SHA-256, one field per line with a
final newline. The manifest is published at
`/atlas-lite/stable/manifest.json`.

Builds without both compile-time values fail closed with `Updates not
configured`; users cannot enter an arbitrary URL. Interrupted writes leave the
current slot bootable. After reboot, ESP-IDF rollback remains armed until
firmware completes fatal board/configuration/network/client initialization and
reaches the main-loop-ready checkpoint, when it marks the running slot valid.

An OTA artifact must be the ESP-IDF application image for the configured OTA
partition, not the ELF and not a guessed merged/raw-address image. Publication
and signing remain release-operator steps and are not performed by this Draft
PR. The first signed artifact, update, rollback, and ROM recovery must be
validated on physical hardware before any release.

## Skip validation during a repeated local build

```bash
./scripts/build-release-firmware.sh --skip-validate
```

Use this only after the exact source tree has already passed
`./scripts/validate.sh`.

## Package cleaned source

```bash
./scripts/package-release.sh
```

This produces:

```text
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>-github-ready.zip
dist/waveshare-epd397-rust-app-v<VERSION>-github-ready.zip.sha256
```

The source package excludes Git metadata, build outputs, generated release
artifacts, local caches, patch scratch files, and extracted overlay directories.
