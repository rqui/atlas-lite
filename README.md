# Atlas Lite

Atlas Lite is a native Atlas e-paper client for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-ePaper-3.97. It is based on [Rustmix Wave](https://github.com/aimindseye/rustmix-wave), remains pre-MVP/bring-up, and is not an official Rustmix Wave release or otherwise affiliated with its upstream project.

Hardware status: **NOT TESTED**. Host validation and an ESP-IDF build do not validate the physical board.

M8 software candidate: first boot now uses a temporary password-protected Atlas Lite setup AP, stores Wi-Fi/Atlas configuration only in NVS, then performs short-code pairing through Atlas Web. Product Settings exposes status, signed fixed-origin OTA, restart, Wi-Fi reset, server-confirmed unpair, and factory reset; holding BOOT during startup reopens setup after clearing only local Atlas Lite configuration. The candidate also has an ESP32-S3 light-sleep/input contract; see [`docs/M8_PRODUCTIZATION.md`](docs/M8_PRODUCTIZATION.md) and [`docs/POWER_INPUT.md`](docs/POWER_INPUT.md). Physical provisioning, radio, power, OTA rollback, and recovery remain **NOT TESTED**.

The authoritative roadmap is [`docs/implementation/ATLAS-LITE-01.md`](docs/implementation/ATLAS-LITE-01.md). Atlas-specific architecture is in [`docs/ATLAS_LITE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ATLAS_LITE_ARCHITECTURE.md); upstream platform architecture remains in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Upstream Rustmix Wave platform reference

Atlas Lite reuses the Rustmix Wave Rust / ESP-IDF platform for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 3.97-inch e-paper board. The native panel is `800 × 480`; the inherited product UI renders on a logical `480 × 800` portrait canvas. The following sections preserve upstream capability and release reference material; they do not claim those product features or physical hardware behavior have been validated for Atlas Lite.

Current release: **v1.0.0** (`text-editor-layout-alignment`; screenshot documentation refresh).

This repository is the cleaned source tree. Historical patch overlays, temporary ZIP archives, patch scripts, repair notes, and milestone-by-milestone smoke-test documents have been removed. Durable documentation is consolidated into this README and the small set of files under [`docs/`](docs/). A screenshot-driven operating guide is available at [`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`](docs/USER_GUIDE.md), with reference images stored under [`screenshots/`](screenshots/).

<!-- RUSTMIX_WAVE_BLE_RELEASE_NOTICE_START -->

## Rustmix Remote BLE release

Rustmix Wave now has a dedicated BLE Remote firmware release for using a Samsung Wear OS watch as a page-turning remote.

Use the BLE release when you want:

- Rustmix Remote Wear OS app support
- BLE GATT page-turning
- TXT reader Previous / Next page control
- EPUB reader Previous / Next page control
- Saved/direct BLE MAC fallback connection from the watch app
- A dedicated low-distraction remote-control workflow

The BLE release is intended for the Rustmix Remote watch app:

    Wear OS watch
        -> BLE GATT
        -> Rustmix-Wave
        -> TXT / EPUB reader page turn

### Which release should I install?

| Need | Install this release |
|---|---|
| Normal reader use with Wi-Fi transfer, weather, NTP/time sync, and network features | `v1.2.0-wifi` |
| Samsung Wear OS Rustmix Remote page turning for TXT and EPUB | `v1.2.0-ble` |

### BLE release capabilities

The `v1.2.0-ble` firmware supports:

- BLE advertising for Rustmix Remote
- Rustmix Remote BLE GATT service
- RRBP command packets
- Previous page command
- Next page command
- TXT reader page turning
- EPUB reader page turning

Accepted Rustmix Remote app behavior:

- Swipeable Remote / Device UI
- Saved BLE device address
- Connect Saved
- Scan / Fallback
- Disconnect
- Status text for connection and write activity

### Important BLE release limitation

The BLE release intentionally disables Wi-Fi/network features.

Disabled in `v1.2.0-ble`:

- Wi-Fi transfer portal
- NTP/time sync
- weather/network fetch
- Wi-Fi connection workflow

Use `v1.2.0-wifi` if you need those features.

### Why are Wi-Fi and BLE separate releases?

The Waveshare ESP32-S3 3.97-inch e-paper device uses one ESP32-S3 radio subsystem for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE. Rustmix Wave also has several memory-sensitive and timing-sensitive subsystems:

- e-paper refresh coordination
- SD card access
- TXT/EPUB reader cache workers
- audio and voice notes
- weather/network tasks
- Wi-Fi transfer web portal
- BLE GATT command service

For the accepted Rustmix Remote path, the BLE build gives BLE ownership of the modem and skips Wi-Fi/network services. This keeps watch page turning reliable while preserving a separate Wi-Fi build for normal daily use.

### BLE firmware build

    cd /home/mindseye73/Documents/projects/rustmix-wave

    export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
    export RUSTFLAGS="${RUSTFLAGS:-} --cfg esp_idf_version_least_5_5_0"

    cargo +esp build \
      --release \
      --target xtensa-esp32s3-espidf \
      --features rustmix-remote-ble

### BLE firmware flash

    espflash flash --chip esp32s3 --monitor \
      target/xtensa-esp32s3-espidf/release/waveshare-epd397-rust-app

Expected BLE logs:

    rustmix-wave=rustmix-remote-gap event=AdvertisingStarted(Success)
    rustmix-wave=rustmix-remote-gatts event=PeerConnected
    rustmix-wave=rustmix-remote-gatts event=Write
    rustmix-wave=rustmix-remote-command status=enqueued
    rustmix-wave=rustmix-remote-event event=page-next route=reader-page
    rustmix-wave=rustmix-remote-event event=page-previous route=reader-page

### Rustmix Remote watch app

Rustmix Remote v1.0.0 is the validated Wear OS companion app:

## Sensor-driven utilities and motion games

Rustmix Wave uses the board peripherals as product features rather than treating them as diagnostics only.

| Hardware service | Firmware use |
| --- | --- |
| PCF85063 RTC | Localized clock, calendar date, persistent alarm schedules, and GPIO45 alarm wake |
| AXP2101 PMIC | Battery and USB/charge status, e-paper rail support, and Power-key short/long interrupt classification |
| SHTC3 environment sensor | Temperature and humidity cards, home status, and sensor details |
| QMI8658 accelerometer and gyroscope | Live Motion diagnostics, debounced `TILT`, `SHAKE`, `ROTATE`, and `LEVEL` events, Tilt Maze, Motion 2048, and Sokoban Tilt |
| ES8311 audio codec and I2S | Alarm chime, audio diagnostics, Voice Notes recording, and saved-WAV playback |
| SDMMC storage | Reader library, Voice Notes, Dictionary shards, Calendar events, sleep images, Wi-Fi transfer, and SD-loaded app packs |
| Wi-Fi and SNTP | Network status, RTC synchronization, weather fetch, and explicit LAN file transfer |

The native IMU event bridge keeps raw QMI8658 I2C samples inside Rust. It converts fixed-point accelerometer and gyroscope snapshots into debounced events with release latching and cooldowns. Motion games receive those bounded native events rather than raw I2C access:

- **Tilt Maze** maps planar tilt into maze movement.
- **Motion 2048** maps tilt into swipe directions for tile slides and merges.
- **Sokoban Tilt** maps tilt into player movement and crate pushes.

See [`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for the screen-by-screen controls and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the sensor pipeline.

## Main-task safety and worker isolation

The ESP-IDF main task remains the narrow hardware-orchestration owner. It owns display refresh coordination, UI routing, and long-lived peripheral handles. Stack-heavy or blocking operations are isolated behind bounded workers or dedicated service tasks:

| Operation | Isolation policy |
| --- | --- |
| EPUB parse | Short-lived `epub-parser` worker with a 64 KiB stack |
| EPUB title lookup | Short-lived title worker with a 32 KiB stack |
| Weather HTTPS fetch | Short-lived `weather-fetch` worker with a 64 KiB stack and bounded response payload |
| Lua app open | Short-lived `lua-loader` worker with a 32 KiB stack |
| Wi-Fi transfer portal | Explicitly started ESP-IDF HTTP server task with a 24 KiB stack and 4 KiB stream chunks |
| Voice Notes capture and playback | Cooperative bounded I2S chunks while native `AudioRuntime` retains codec ownership |

`AppState` is heap-boxed, runtime memory snapshots report main-stack high-water margin and internal/PSRAM heap state, and workers return compact results before terminating. Lua apps never receive panel SPI, raw I2C, networking, or long-lived hardware handles.

```

The architecture and module ownership rules are documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Prerequisites

Install the ESP Rust toolchain, ESP-IDF build dependencies, and `espflash`. The repository selects the `esp` toolchain through [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) and pins ESP-IDF settings in [`.cargo/config.toml`](.cargo/config.toml).

The stable Rust toolchain is also required for formatting and native host tests.

## Validate

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

This runs:

```text
cargo +stable fmt --all -- --check
./scripts/validate_source_contract.sh
./scripts/test-host.sh
```

Host tests explicitly use the detected native target so they do not inherit the repository default `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf` target.

## Build

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

Equivalent embedded release build:

```bash
cargo +esp build --release --target xtensa-esp32s3-espidf
```

## Flash and monitor

```bash
./scripts/flash.sh --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

## Build an initial-install candidate

```bash
./scripts/build-release-firmware.sh
```

The script validates the source, builds in an isolated target directory, and
creates a self-contained ZIP under `dist/` with the matching application ELF,
bootloader, partition table, checksums and installer. After verifying checksums,
flash only with an explicit port:

```bash
cd dist/atlas-lite-install-v1.0.0
./flash-atlas-lite.sh --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

Do not use `espflash write-bin`: it is a raw-address operation. The installer
uses the bundle's explicit `espflash.toml` to select matching bootloader/table.
A merged factory-image workflow remains deferred until physical validation.

See [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).

## Package a cleaned source archive

```bash
./scripts/package-release.sh
```

The output is written below `dist/` and excludes local build products, generated release artifacts, caches, temporary files, and extracted patch-overlay directories.

## SD-card setup

Install the bundled examples:

```bash
./scripts/install-sd-examples.sh /Volumes/YOUR_SD_CARD
```

Install the complete X4 Dictionary pack:

```bash
./scripts/install-dictionary-x4-pack.sh \
  --force \
  --x4-repo /Users/piyushdaiya/Documents/projects/rustmix-x4-firmware \
  /Volumes/YOUR_SD_CARD
```

Install the U.S.-only X4 Calendar pack:

```bash
./scripts/install-calendar-x4-pack.sh \
  --force \
  --x4-repo /Users/piyushdaiya/Documents/projects/rustmix-x4-firmware \
  /Volumes/YOUR_SD_CARD
```

See [`docs/SD_CARD_SETUP.md`](docs/SD_CARD_SETUP.md) for the complete storage contract.

## Input conventions

```text
ROTARY               Move the current selection
SELECT               Activate the current selection
BOOT short           Contextual action; keyboard/grid screens toggle NAV H / NAV V
BOOT long             Hierarchical Back
Power short          Open display-maintenance menu
Power long           Enter sleep-image mode
```

All new keyboard or grid-style text-entry screens should compose the shared `KeyboardGridNavigation` helper so BOOT-short H/V axis switching is consistent across apps.
